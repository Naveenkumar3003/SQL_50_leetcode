Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.
Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

select id, 
    case 
        when id%2 =1 and id<(select max(id) from Seat)
            then (select student from Seat where id=s.id+1)
        when id%2=0 
            then (select student from Seat where id=s.id-1)
        else student
    end as student
from Seat s
order by id;
